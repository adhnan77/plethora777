"Let's suppose they're just 10,000 times better," says James Walker, former director of the Sensory Research Institute at Florida State University, who, with several colleagues, came up with that jaw-dropping estimate during a rigorously designed, oft-cited study.

Avocados must be picked when matured in order to ripen, which can take between 1-2 weeks. In Spain and Mexico, avocados are called “alligator pears” due to their shape and bumpy, green skin, while in India and China, they are referred to as “butter pears”. This healthy food is good for you too! They're a great source of vitamin C, E, K, and B-6.</p>

It will eliminate the mist and provide a soothing, spa-like fragrance. If you’ve written something in pen and made a mistake, the outside waxy coating of the cucumber can also be used to erase pen writing! Fun fact: did you know that cucumbers are 96% water?</p>

An avid gambler, John Montagu was on a 24-hour streak and did not want to leave his table. He wanted to eat without having to put his cards down… thus the sandwich was born!, One small step for man, one giant leap for…. sandwiches?,Another fun fact about sandwiches is that one has been smuggled into space!Astronaut John Young smuggled a corned beef sandwich onto his spacecraft for a six-hour mission. The sandwich didn’t go too well in zero gravity conditions and could have actually had grave consequences. Floating crumbs or debris could have caused serious damage to the shuttle, but luckily they returned unharmed. NASA have since taken steps to ensure no sandwich goes into space again.</p>
